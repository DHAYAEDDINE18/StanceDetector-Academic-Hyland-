Earlier we have mentioned that each MU needs to be treated in its own right because of the process that made it and what it has become in text.,self_mention,we,1,2,,
Hoa Mai’s case gives us even more reason to do so.,self_mention,us,6,7,,
"Summary It has been shown that, 1.",boosting,shown,4,5,,
The results show that novel metaphors are the insignia of creativity that requires cognitive efforts.,boosting,show,2,3,,
"The making of conventional MUs involved largely ideational thinking and lexical considerations, indicating that conventional metaphors are an inherent part of normal language use.",boosting,indicating,13,14,,
This suggests that learners’ metaphoricity in an L2 is more associated with proficiency than with conceptual issues.,hedging,suggests,1,2,,
"As we have seen, this does not mean that metaphorical language production involves low- level processing.",self_mention,we,1,2,,
"The average time devoted to metaphorical language is 292.401s, i.e., about four minutes and 873ms out of about 30 minutes 885ms (1853.117s) of total pause time equal or longer than two seconds, out of total composing time of approximately 55 minutes and 962ms (3335.772s).",hedging,approximately,43,44,,
"Examining the association between total pause time and number of verbalized thoughts, we can see a weak correlation: r = 0.17, which is statistically significant (p < 0.0001).",self_mention,we,13,14,,
"Because this result could be due to the large sample size (685 MUs, which includes the non-paused ones), the test was repeated with only paused MUs.",hedging,could,3,4,,
"A pause duration of two seconds might be a gateway to a larger processing load than, say, a pause of four seconds; and any two three-second pauses cannot be assumed to carry the same processing value (see Schilperoord, 2001 for further discussion).",hedging,might,6,7,,
Its processing load may have been handled at an earlier stage of the writing process (as in Hoa Mai’s case) or at an earlier point of the stretch of text under construction.,hedging,may,3,4,,
"In other studies in L2 writing, it has been found that pausing can take up to 60 or 70% of total composition time (Alamargot, Dansac, Chesnet, & Fayol, 2007) and pausing at a threshold longer than two seconds may require 41% of writing time (Wengelin, 1999).",hedging,may,46,47,,
"Planning takes about 30-60% of total composing time (Cumming, 1990), formulation (converting ideas into language) takes minimally 60% (Roca de Larios, Manchón, Murphy, & Marín, 2008), and solving formulation problems takes about 20% to 25% of total composing time (Roca de Larios, Manchón, & Murphy, 2006).40 Although the methodology is different, a rough comparison with these studies shows that 15.78% of total processing time is a reasonable amount to invest, given that metaphorical language makes up 14.42% of the total text.",boosting,shows,81,82,,
"First, language learners’ linguistic metaphors seem to be, at least according to what they manage to verbalise in the retrospective interviews, products of propositional and linguistic reasoning more than metaphoric thinking.",hedging,seem,7,8,,
The participants’ reports have also suggested that metaphors in text are not entirely due to metaphoric thinking.,hedging,suggested,6,7,,
"However, metaphors in text may be produced on request, as when the writers intentionally configure a rhetorical effect in communication, as seen in the case of Xuân.",hedging,may,5,6,,
The combination of two sources of data has provided us with insights into metaphor use in L2 learners from a dual perspective that has not been tried before.,self_mention,us,9,10,,
"We can now understand (at least partly) the patterns and variations of metaphor use in the making, together with the different variables of this process.",self_mention,we,0,1,,
I will mention a few of these in Chapter 6.,self_mention,i,0,1,,
"The Motivated Nature of Language Learners might not need to possess metalinguistic knowledge about the different types of metaphorical language, but they need to know that a number of words, which form the keyness of the texts they encounter and produce, are used in extended senses and are related to the basic senses in meaningful ways.",hedging,might,6,7,,
"To present this knowledge in a light way, the teacher can demonstrate one well-prepared example in each meeting alongside the focus of the lesson and show learners the path to deepen this knowledge on their own.",boosting,demonstrate,12,13,,
"Although the extended senses of a word can be presented in a network map of radial categories, I would be cautious about introducing such maps to learners.",self_mention,i,18,19,,
The main purpose of such maps should be to increase awareness of how senses of the English words can be extended via metaphor so that learners may exploit similar strategies when encountering new words.,hedging,may,26,27,,
Contextualising Input We have seen from the examples presented in the previous two chapters that the participants at all levels of proficiency produced inter-MUs due to confusions about the different senses of a word and the different usages of senses.,self_mention,we,2,3,,
"These problems are likely manifestations of an approach to vocabulary learning which (a) emphasizes the number of words over the usage of words in contexts and (b) treats members of multi-word units as individual words (as similarly reported among the participants in Barfield, 2009; Peters, 2009; Ying & O’Neill, 2009).",hedging,likely,3,4,,
"Croft & Cruse, 2004; Jackendoff, 2002; Sullivan, 2009, 2013), these frames would be likely to be activated at the formulation point of the propositions.",hedging,likely,21,22,,
"It must be made clear that this context of use is not limited to the linguistic patterns in which a word/phrase appears (e.g., Brown, 1993; Jiang, 2000, 2004) but is extended to the contexts of genres, language varieties, professional or subject domains as well as the socio-cultural contexts in which the task is situated.",hedging,appears,21,22,,
"According to Yang and O’Neill (2009), learners at the borderline between the intermediate and advanced stages of learning (those similar to the Year 3 and Year 4 cohorts in this project) would be most likely to benefit from these corpus-based syntagmatic activities.",hedging,likely,41,42,,

Yet only a fragmented definition of words can be expected in the dictionaries that I found most popular among my students in Vietnam.,self_mention,my,19,20,,
Learning with such dictionaries would be likely to result in learners holding an assumption of a one-to-one relationship between word and meaning; usage is of course an unaffordable luxury in these dictionaries.,hedging,likely,6,7,,
Yet writing could not be accomplished without words.,hedging,could,2,3,,
"By not spending time to help students develop and command their productive vocabulary resources, we are not helping learners’ writing.",self_mention,we,15,16,,
"Writing quality would improve if learners could use words to precisely express what they intend to mean in the intended subtleties of genre, tone or stance and to coherently link their points of argument.",hedging,could,6,7,,
"Pre-task discussions or reading activities using the target phrases may induce learners to re-use them in the production task (Duin & Graves, 1987; S. Lee & Muncie, 2006).",hedging,may,9,10,,
"Lee’s (2003) study, for example, shows that with teacher elicitation, secondary ESL learners can increase productive recognized target vocabulary 63.62% as compared to only 13.19% without teacher elicitation.",boosting,shows,11,12,,
"Literature in both L1 and L2 suggests that self-selected lexis are better retained and re-used (Haggard, 1982, 1986; Jiménez, 1997; Ruddell & Shearer, 2002).",hedging,suggests,6,7,,
"The quantity of phraseological units in teacher speech, an important source of input in EFL settings, may have a consequential effect on learners’ (under)production of these units.",hedging,may,18,19,,
"Training in lexical retrieval fluency by focusing on speed and correctness (Snellings, van Gelderen, & de Glopper, 2002; Snellings et al., 2004) may reduce the cognitive load of generating text, allowing learners to focus on other sub-processes.",hedging,may,29,30,,

"The findings have shown that conventional MUs increased by each year level (except between Year 2 and Year 3); improvement in inter-MUs and multi-word MUs were found at alternative years, and there was no difference in the use of novel MUs between the year levels, except between Year 1 and Year 4.",boosting,shown,3,4,,

"As such, the participants’ reports suggested that forming ideas and searching for words to express these ideas were key motives of their use of metaphorical language.",hedging,suggested,7,8,,
"As it was strictly required that the participants must know that the study was on metaphorical language in their written essays (rather than just their written language), the participants might have tried to produce more metaphors to please the researcher, especially when they worked directly with the researcher.",hedging,might,32,33,,
The effect could be seen very clearly in the case of Xuân in Study 2 of the project.,hedging,could,2,3,,

"Data Elicitation The data in Study 1 was cross-sectional, which could describe the patterns of metaphorical language in these random samples, but did not allow for the generalizability of the study in terms of a developmental trend.",hedging,could,11,12,,
A combination of keystroke logging and eye- tracking tools may increase the richness of the data yielded (cf.,hedging,may,9,10,,
"In addition, to avoid latency in retrospective interviews, the researcher may want to try pausing the participant immediately after s/he has produced a potential metaphorical unit or after s/he has finished a sentence or a paragraph.",hedging,may,12,13,,
"With regard to Study 1, the number of MUs also seemed to increase with the number of words.",hedging,seemed,11,12,,
